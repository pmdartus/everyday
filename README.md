## High-order function & First-order functions (01-17-16)

**High-order** function are functions that does one of the following:
* take one or more functions as parameter
* returns a function as results
For instance the `map` method is a high order function, because `map` takes a list of element and function and return a new list of elements on which the function has been applied.

**First-order** functions are a feature language allowing functions to be treated as objects. They can be assigned to variables.

First-order functions is specific to programming language compared to the high-order function notion that can be applied to math. But even if those notions are completely different, it's hard to imagine a language that provides first-order functions support without any high-order functions.
